 Project Description:
This project involves building a simple but functional chatbot using Python and Natural Language Processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy. The chatbot will be capable of understanding user queries and providing relevant, rule-based or pattern-matched responses.

This serves as a foundation for developing more advanced conversational systems in areas like customer support, education, and virtual assistants.

üéØ Objective:
To develop a text-based conversational bot that:

Understands user queries using NLP techniques

Responds appropriately from a predefined knowledge base

Demonstrates how real chatbots are structured internally

üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used:
Python 3

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy

Regular Expressions (re) for pattern matching

Optional: JSON or CSV for storing responses

üí° Chatbot Use Cases (choose one):
FAQ Bot for a website or product

Student assistant answering course-related queries

Customer support for simple service questions

Weather or time assistant (rule-based)

üì¶ Sample Features:
Greeting detection ("hi", "hello")

FAQ matching ("what is your name?")

Pattern-based responses ("how are you?", "who created you?")

Default fallback when input is unknown

üîÅ Workflow Steps:
Import Required Libraries

Preprocess User Input

Tokenization

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation/stop words (optional)

Match Input to Response

Keyword or rule-based matching (e.g., with regex or string search)

Optionally use spaCy/NLTK for similarity scoring

Return the Response

From a dictionary, list, or custom logic

Loop Until User Exits
